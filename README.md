## omzgit

A __GUI__ app is like cruising with a fancy dashboard and auto-pilot. It looks great and gets you there with minimal effort.

The __CLI__? That’s like riding a manual motorcycle: raw, fast, and thrilling, but only if you know what you’re doing.

what about __omzgit?__

Not too long ago, I found out about [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). Both projects are amazing and huge inspirations for this project. 

lazygit is great, but I wanted it to look more like what I am used to seeing in VSCode git editor. VSCode is good, but when I started to learn Vim I wanted the functionality of shortucts and the feeling of not using a mouse. So when I looked at ohmyzsh, specifically about the git part documented in the git [cheat sheet](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Oh-My-Zsh_Git.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index), I had a vision.

What if I make a terminal UI project which looks simplistic for a newbie like me, but holds the power of commands inspired by the Oh-My-Zsh Git Cheat Sheet? And that's when omzgit was born.
